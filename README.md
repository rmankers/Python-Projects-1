1) Identifying Humor with Text Analytics</br>
</br>
This project explores several machine learning models and their performance predicting which jokes from a set are "funny." 
The data comprised user ratings on ~150 jokes and the jokes themselves. Ratings were used to determine "funny" labels for 
each joke.

2) Website Automation</br>
</br>
This code automates the reservation of conference rooms by booking a room everyday at midnight, a given number of weeks in advance. Given the reservation URL the script will:</br>
  -Open the URL</br>
  -Input username and password to Shiboleth password protection</br>
  -Request a push from DUO authentication</br>
  -Access the scheduler and book a given room at a given time, a given number of weeks in advance</br>
