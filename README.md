1) Identifying Humor with Text Analytics
This project explores several machine learning models and their performance predicting which jokes from a set are "funny." 
The data comprised user ratings on ~150 jokes and the jokes themselves. Ratings were used to determine "funny" labels for 
each joke.

2) Website Automation
This code automates the reservation of conference rooms by booking a room everyday at midnight, a given number of weeks in advance. Given the reservation URL the script will:

  -Open the URL<\br>
  -Input username and password to Shiboleth password protection
  -Request a push from DUO authentication
  -Access the scheduler and book a given room at a given time, a given number of weeks in advance
